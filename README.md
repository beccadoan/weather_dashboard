Welcome to the easiest place to get weather info!

With this web application, you can search any city, and get the current info on the weather, as well as the forecast for the next 5 days. 

Your search results will be stored, so do not worry! If you want to search the same city you recently searched, you can just click on it instead of typing it in again.

The following photo is an example of the app with weather data about Austin, TX.
